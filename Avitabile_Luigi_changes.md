# Project Update Summary

## Overview of Changes

- **Folder Structure Refactoring:**
  Organized the project by creating dedicated folders for each operation type:
  - `controllers`
  - `services`
  - `repositories`
  - `models`
  This restructuring improves code visibility and maintainability.

- **Improved Input Validation:**
  Enhanced the efficiency of input validation checks in several cases, ensuring more robust and reliable data handling.

- **Service Separation:**
  The main `Hospital` service has been split into two distinct entities:
  - `Patient` service
  - `Appointments` service
  Each now has its own dedicated APIs, allowing for better modularity and scalability.

- **Unit Testing Efforts:**
  Initiated the implementation of unit tests to improve code reliability and support future development. Testing coverage is currently in progress.

This refactoring aims to make the codebase clearer, more modular, and easier to extend or maintain in the future.
